# Django_Tour_Proj1

Hello.
First of all i want to say that we are making back of the tour website for it we have to do some commands.
We will Do the commands for Windows/MacOs/Linux OS
Lets begin.
In the first place we make our repository in github for this porject after we clone the adrress like this in github.com we add repositor and that we clone it in our computer were we want.
The cloning will be git clone and the path of repository
As it's a new project we have to use or conda or virtual environment
Windows:
1.py or python  -m venv venv we create for our windows os Virtual environment
2.We have to activate it: venv\Scripts\activate

On MacOs we activate: source venv/bin/activate
but before activateion you have to make your venv: pyhton3 -m venv venv as Macos autamatically has its python2 

On linux: python -m venv venv
activate: source .venv/bin/activate

We can use anaconda for conda environment

For windows we have to upgrade our pip: 
python3 or py or python -m pip install --upgrade pip
use this command and it's install every upgraded version of pip

on windows,Linux and Macos we install django: pip install django

if we use conda we have to create the django environement:
conda create -n djangoenv python=x.x anaconda or other name which you choose for your django environment,  the version which is latest and that activate it: conda activate and the name of your conda django environment

On conda you have to install environement to as conda install -n djangoenv anaconda or you environment name

You have to install django on anaconda: 
conda install -c anaconda django 

after is to install pillow: 
windows: 
venv: pip install pillow
conda: conda install -c anaconda pillow 
Linux: 
venv: pip install pillow
conda: conda install -c anaconda pillow 
Macos: 
venv: pip install pillow
conda: conda install -c anaconda pillow 



After installing the requirements for the environment we start our project.
